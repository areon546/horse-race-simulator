# Horse Racing Simulator OOP Coursework

Part 1 contains a command line implementation of a horse racer simulator based on the assigned files given to complete the coursework. 

part 2 contains a GUI implementation of the same horse racing simulation, but with a couple additional classes, and a GUI (eventually)

## Setup steps:

1. Unzip the zip file downloaded. 
2. Run HorseRacer.class in the folder Part1, with the command 'java HorseRacer', for a demonstration of the program in the command line. 
3. Run HorseRacerGUI.class in the folder Part2, with the command 'java HorseRacerGUI' from the command line, for a demonstration of the program as a GUI. // TODO not currently implemented

## Dependencies
Java

## Usage Guidelines
If you wish to use the Race class in the command line, use the method 'startRace()' on a Race object, in the form 
'raceObject.startRace()' in your program after importing HorseRaceSimulator.Part1, or if you wish to use the GUI implementation, use the method 'startRaceGUI()' on a Race object in your program after importing HorseRaceSimulator.Part2 in your program. 

Objects of the Race class have 3 lanes by default, to which Horse objects can be added to. This has to be done before running the command 'startRace()' or 'startRaceGUI()' in order to work.
